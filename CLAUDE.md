# Claude Code Rules

## File headers

When creating **new** files, use the MIT license header **without** the Meta copyright line:

```
/**
 * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the
 * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
 */
```

Do **not** add:
```
 * Copyright (c) Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates.
 *
```

Existing files from the upstream ISL repo keep their original Meta copyright intact — do not remove it from files you didn't create.
